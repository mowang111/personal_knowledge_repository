## 可用表达
- hello，pi! how is your day?
- get a drive’s license
- I’d like to share you some of my experiences these days.
- I've been learning to drive lately
- I leave for 9 a.m. to arrive at the driving school and go home at 5 p.m. every day, and there is no holiday until the end of the test
- The most annoying thing is that there are about a dozen people sharing a car, and it is often necessary to wait an hour or two to practice
- The driving test is divided into four subje/cts, subject 1 and subject 4 are both theoretical tests, and subjects 2 and 3 are practical tests.
- There are five different tasks in Subject 2, including parallel parking, side parking, right angle turn, S-curve, and uphill parking.
- Right now, I'm really worried that I might not pass the subject 2 exam, which means I'll have to wait another month to retake it.
