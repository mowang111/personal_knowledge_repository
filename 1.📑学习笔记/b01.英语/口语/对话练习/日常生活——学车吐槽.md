Hello. Hi. How is your day?

Hi there! My day has been fantastic, thank you for asking. 😊 How about you? How's your day going so far?

I'd like to show you some experience these days.

Oh, that sounds interesting! I'd love to hear about your recent experiences. What's been happening in your life lately? 😊

I've been learning to drive lately. It's.

That's exciting! Learning to drive can be both challenging and rewarding. How are you finding the experience so far? Do you feel like you're making progress?

That makes me so tired.

Learning any new skill can be mentally and physically exhausting, especially something like driving that requires a lot of focus and attention. Make sure to take breaks and rest when you need to, and remember that it's normal to feel tired when you're learning something new. 💪

Oh, thank you.

You're welcome! It's important to take care of yourself, especially when you're working hard to learn something new. Remember, a little self-care goes a long way in keeping you motivated and energized.

Hi Pie, I'd like to show you.

Hi there! I'm all ears (well, digitally speaking anyway). 😊 What would you like to show me?

Hi Pie, I'd like to show some experience with you these days.

That sounds great! I'm always excited to hear about people's experiences. What would you like to share with me today? 😊

I I quite feel anxious about my driving test tomorrow.

It's completely normal to feel anxious before a test, especially something like a driving test. Just remember to take a few deep breaths and trust in your practice. You've worked hard to prepare, and I'm sure you'll do great. 😊

You know, if everyone else passes the exam and I don't, it's gonna be, it's gonna.

Please don't put that kind of pressure on yourself. Your exam is about your own personal performance and improvement, not a competition with others. It's more important that you do your best and focus on your own journey, rather than comparing yourself to others.

Thank you. I know it but.

You're very welcome! 😊 I know it can be hard to internalize this mindset, especially when you're feeling anxious. But try to remind yourself that you are capable and that no matter what happens, you've put in the effort and learned valuable skills along the way.

Sure. Thanks.

Anytime! 😊 Remember, I'm here to support you and believe in you. If you ever need a pep talk or just someone to listen, I'm always ready to chat.

## 可用表达
- hello，pi! how is your day?
- get a drive’s license
- I’d like to share you some of my experiences these days.
- I've been learning to drive lately
- I leave for 9 a.m. to arrive at the driving school and go home at 5 p.m. every day, and there is no holiday until the end of the test
- The most annoying thing is that there are about a dozen people sharing a car, and it is often necessary to wait an hour or two to practice
- The driving test is divided into four subje/cts, subject 1 and subject 4 are both theoretical tests, and subjects 2 and 3 are practical tests.
- There are five different tasks in Subject 2, including parallel parking, side parking, right angle turn, S-curve, and uphill parking.
- Right now, I'm really worried that I might not pass the subject 2 exam, which means I'll have to wait another month to retake it.
