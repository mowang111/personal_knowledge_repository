## 对话练习

### 尝试1
+ 目标：简单抱怨一下学车很辛苦

```
Hello. Hi. How is your day?

Hi there! My day has been fantastic, thank you for asking. 😊 How about you? How's your day going so far?

I'd like to show you some experience these days.

Oh, that sounds interesting! I'd love to hear about your recent experiences. What's been happening in your life lately? 😊

I've been learning to drive lately. It's.

That's exciting! Learning to drive can be both challenging and rewarding. How are you finding the experience so far? Do you feel like you're making progress?

That makes me so tired.

Learning any new skill can be mentally and physically exhausting, especially something like driving that requires a lot of focus and attention. Make sure to take breaks and rest when you need to, and remember that it's normal to feel tired when you're learning something new. 💪

Oh, thank you.

You're welcome! It's important to take care of yourself, especially when you're working hard to learn something new. Remember, a little self-care goes a long way in keeping you motivated and energized.

	+ 玩意其他人都通过了，而自己不通过的难过心理
	+ 之后需要补考很麻烦，因为补考需要一个月之后


## 可用表达
- hello，pi! how is your day?
- get a drive’s license
- I’d like to share you some of my experiences these days.
- I've been learning to drive lately
- I leave for 9 a.m. to arrive at the driving school and go home at 5 p.m. every day, and there is no holiday until the end of the test
- The most annoying thing is that there are about a dozen people sharing a car, and it is often necessary to wait an hour or two to practice
- The driving test is divided into four subje/cts, subject 1 and subject 4 are both theoretical tests, and subjects 2 and 3 are practical tests.
- There are five different tasks in Subject 2, including parallel parking, side parking, right angle turn, S-curve, and uphill parking.
- Right now, I'm really worried that I might not pass the subject 2 exam, which means I'll have to wait another month to retake it.
