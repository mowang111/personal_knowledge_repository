# Database

Organized collection of inter-related data that  models some aspect of the real-world. 

Databases are core the component of most  computer applications

# Flat file strawman

Store our database as comma-separated value  (CSV) files that we manage in our own code.

+ Use a separate file per entity. 
+ The application has to parse the files each time they want  to read/update records.

# Database management system

A DBMS is software that allows applications to  store and analyze information in a database.

# Data models

> A data model is collection of concepts for  describing the data in a database. 
>
> A schema is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model

+ Relational 
+ Key/Value 
+ Graph 
+ Document 
+ Column-family 
+ Array / Matrix 
+ Hierarchical 
+ Network

# Relational model

A <font color='red'>relation</font> is unordered set that contain the relationship of attributes that represent entities

> n-ary Relation = Table with n columns

A <font color='red'>tuple</font> is a set of attribute values(also known as its domain)in the relation

+ Values are(normally) atomic/scalar
+ The special value NULL is a member of every domain

## Primary keys

A relation's primary key uniquely identifies a single tuple

Some DBMSS automatically create an internal primary key if you don't define one

Auto-generation of unique integer primary Keys

+ SEQUENCE(SQL:2003)
+ AUTO_INCREMENT (MYSQL)

## Foreign keys

A foreign key specifies that an attribute from one relation has to map to a tuple in another relation

# Data manipulation languages(DML)

How to store and retrieve information from a database

+ Procedural
  The query specifies the(high-level) strategy the DBMS should use to find the desired result
+ Non-procedural
  The query specifies only what data is wanted and not how to find it

# Relational algebra

![relational algebra](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mowang111/image-hosting/master/computer/relational algebra.6brh60873fw.png)

Fundamental operations to retrieve and manipulate tuples in a relation.

> Based on set algebra

Each operator takes one or more relations as Its inputs and outputs a new relation

> We can"chain" operators together to create more complex operations

## select

Choose a subset of the tuples from a relation that satisfies a selection predicate.
Predicate acts as a filter to retain only tuples that fulfill its qualifying
requirement
Can combine multiple predicates using conjunctions/ disjunctions.

## projection

Generate a relation with tuples that contains only the specified attributes

+ Can rearrange attributes ordering
+ Can manipulate the values

## union

Generate a relation that contains all tuples that appear in either only one or both input relations

## difference

Generate a relation that contains only the tuples that appear in the first and not the second of the input relations

## product

Generate a relation that contains all possible combinations of tuples from the input relations

## join

Generate a relation that contains all tuples that are a combination of two tuples(one from each input relation with a common values) for one or more attributes

## extra operators

> observation
>
> Relational algebra still defines the high-level steps of how to compute a query.
>
> A better approach is to state the high-level answer that you want the DBMS to compute

## queries

The relational model is independent of any query  language implementation

SQL is the de facto standard.

# conclusion

Databases are ubiquitous. 

Relational algebra defines the primitives for  processing queries on a relational database.

We will see relational algebra again when we talk  about query optimization + execution
