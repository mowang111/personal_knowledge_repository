## 系统设计目标

+ 让应用程序有一个错觉：超过内存大小的数据库是存储在内存中的
+ 尽量减少读写

What if we allow multiple threads to access the  mmap files to hide page fault stalls?

+ madvise: Tell the OS how you expect to read certain pages
+ mlock: Tell the OS that memory ranges  cannot be paged out.
+ msync: Tell the OS to flush memory  ranges out to disk

## Problem

Problem #1: How the DBMS represents the  database in files on disk.

Problem #2: How the DBMS manages its memory  and moves data back-and-forth from disk



### File Storage

The **storage manager** is responsible for  maintaining a database's files.

It organizes the files as a collection of **pages**.

+ It organizes the files as a collection of pages.
+ It organizes the files as a collection of pages.

A **heap file** is an unordered collection of pages  with tuples that are stored in random order

Two ways to represent a heap file: Linked List, Page Directory



### Page Layout

### Tuple Layout
