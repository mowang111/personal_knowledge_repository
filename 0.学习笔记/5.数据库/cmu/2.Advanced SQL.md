# Relational languages

+ Edgar Codd published major paper on relational models in the early 1970s. He originally only defined the mathematical notation for how a DBMS could execute queries on a relational model DBMS.
+ User only needs to specify the result that they want using a declarative language (i.e., SQL). The DBMS is responsible for determining the most efficient plan to produce that answer. 
+  Relational algebra is based on sets (unordered, no duplicates). SQL is based on bags (unordered, allows duplicates).
