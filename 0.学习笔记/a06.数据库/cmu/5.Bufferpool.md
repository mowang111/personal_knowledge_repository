## Buffer Pool

The buffer poolâ€™s region of memory organized as an array of fixed size pages. Each array entry is called a frame. When the DBMS requests a page, an exact copy is placed into one of the frames of the buffer pool. Then, the database system can search the buffer pool first when a page is requested. If the page is not found, then the system fetches a copy of the page from the disk.
