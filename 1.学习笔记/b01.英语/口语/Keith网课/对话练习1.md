What specific challenges are you facing right now?

I’ve been keeping busy with work and some personal projects. What about you? What have you been up to lately?
+ I’ve been studying operating systems and English
What’s the most interesting thing you’ve learned recently in your studies?
+ Nothing special.
Is there a particular topic in operating systems or English that you find more challenging or interesting?
+ The experiments in operating systems are very difficult. I always spend a lot of time on them.
What specific aspect of the experiments do you find most challenging?
+ The next experiments are always more difficult, and the challenges gradually increase.
What strategies do you use to tackle these increasing difficulties?
+ I don't control the difficulty myself
What do you follow to manage the difficulties?
+ I follow a class about operating system experiments. In the class, the difficulty of the experiments gradually increases.
How do you manage your time and efforts to handle these challenging experiments?
+ I often start working on operating systems in the morning because I have more energy then. In the afternoon, I like to practice English since it doesn’t require as much mental effort.
How do you usually practice your English in the afternoon?
+ I like to listen to some classes and then practice with you.
What kind of classes do you listen to? Are they more about grammar, vocabulary, or speaking practice?
+ The latest topic was about talking about your hobbies. He gave us phrases such as ‘free time,’ ‘leisure time,’ ‘leisure activities,’ ‘hobbies,’ and ‘pastimes.’ Then he provided different types of free time activities like indoor activities, outdoor activities, collecting things, and creative activities. When someone asks, ‘What do you do in your free time?’ you can respond with, ‘I get up to a lot of different things,’ or ‘I don’t have too much.’
What kind of **leisure activities** do you enjoy besides reading?
+ Recently, I decided to have a go at working out.
