Personally speaking I do agree that being a teacher is eaiser than being a student, cuz take me as an example, as a student, I'm under a lot of pressure, but I don't really have the time to unwind my self, since if I really want to get a good academic performance in school, I have to work really hard, you know try my best to meet the school's requirement and to keep up with my assignment, so whenerver I feel exhausted after a whole day's study and tired of learning my major subjects, I would love to do something like playing sports with my friends, to help refresh my mind, but I don't really have the time for that
