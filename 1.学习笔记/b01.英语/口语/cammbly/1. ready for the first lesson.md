## what are your hobbies?
I don't have any particular hobbies. In China, we are constantly preparing for exams from a young age, all in the name of changing our fate through the Gaokao. Activities outside of coursework are often deemed a complete waste of time. After entering university, I tried to cultivate some hobbies, such as learning a musical instrument or painting, but unfortunately, I didn't stick with any of them. You know, the process is tough. Now, I might want to develop a hobby related to sports, like jogging, primarily for my health. My last check-up revealed that my cholesterol levels are already high. Additionally, learning English might also be considered a hobby, although this is only my first lesson.

## what are your plan for the weekend?
As I've recently graduated and am currently staying at home, my entire week feels like the weekend. I had planned to travel, but upon seeing the costs, I decided against it.

## what is your dream vacation?
It would undoubtedly be a vacation free from any disturbances, where I could be alone by the beach, savoring the sea breeze. Of course, this exists only in my imagination, as I've never actually been to the seaside. Perhaps the dampness and fishy smell of the beach might deter me; who knows?
## what is your dream job?
A fixed work schedule with no interruptions after hours, ample opportunities for personal growth, and of course, a salary sufficient to support my lifestyle.
