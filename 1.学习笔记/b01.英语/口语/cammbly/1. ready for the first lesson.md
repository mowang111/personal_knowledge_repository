## what are your hobbies?
I don't have any particular hobbies. In China, we are constantly preparing for exams from a young age, all in the name of changing our fate through the Gaokao. Activities outside of coursework are often deemed a complete waste of time. After entering university, I tried to cultivate some hobbies, such as learning a musical instrument or painting, but unfortunately, I didn't stick with any of them. You know, the process is tough. Now, I might want to develop a hobby related to sports, like jogging, primarily for my health. My last check-up revealed that my cholesterol levels are already high. Additionally, learning English might also be considered a hobby, although this is only my first lesson.
