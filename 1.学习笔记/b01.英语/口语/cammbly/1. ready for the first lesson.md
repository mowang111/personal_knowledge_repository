## what do you do?
我是名刚毕业的研究生，七月份准备去一家汽车公司入职，做软件开发相关的工作
I am a recent graduate student, and planing to join an automotive company in July,
to work on software development-related tasks.
## what are your hobbies?
I don't have any particular hobbies. In China, we are constantly preparing for exams from a young age, all in the name of changing our fate through the Gaokao. Activities outside of coursework are often deemed a complete waste of time. After entering university, I tried to cultivate some hobbies, such as learning a musical instrument or painting, but unfortunately, I didn't stick with any of them. You know, the process is tough. Now, I might want to develop a hobby related to sports, like jogging, primarily for my health. My last check-up revealed that my cholesterol levels are already high. Additionally, learning English might also be considered a hobby, although this is only my first lesson.

## what is your favorite movie?
我看过的电影不多，还没有特别让我印象深刻的
I haven't watched many movies yet, and none have left a lasting impression on me so far.
## what are your plan for the weekend?
Because I just graduate, and stay at home now, the whole week is my weekend, 我之前打算出去旅游，但是一看到花费就放弃了，路费和旅馆费占了一大部分，我认为那非常不值得，目前的计划就是在家看看书，学习一些编程知识，以及练习英文。

## what is your dream vacation?
那一定是没有任何事物打扰的假期，一个人在沙滩边，享受着海风，当然那只存在于想象，我从来没有去过海边，说不定海边的潮湿和腥臭味会劝退我，谁知道呢？
## what is your dream job?
固定的上下班时间，下班后没有任何打扰，可以有足够的个人成长的机会，sure，还有足够我生活的薪资。
