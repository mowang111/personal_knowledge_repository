When I see this topic, my first thought is that no one can cheat on me for my money, after all I'm a graduated student! After a few minutes, an old things ran into my brain, back when I was a child, there were many of shows on the Televation, which show some simple questions, and then told that once you call them, and gave the right answers, you can get a big prize. I've tried serveal times, but there's no prize at all
