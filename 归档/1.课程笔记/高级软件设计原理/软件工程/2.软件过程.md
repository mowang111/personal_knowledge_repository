# A Generic View of Process

## Generic Process Framework  

1. Communication (customer collaboration and requirement  gathering)  

2. Planning (establishes engineering work plan, describes  technical risks, lists resource requirements, work products  produced, and defines work schedule)  

3. Modeling (creation of models to help developers and  customers understand the requires and software design)  

4. Construction (code generation and testing)  

5. Deployment (software delivered for customer evaluation and  feedback)

   

## The Capability Maturity Model Integration

— by Software Engineering Institute (SEI) of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) 

• Level 0: Incomplete (process is not performed or does not achieve  all goals defined for this level) 

• Level 1: Performed (work tasks required to produce required work  products are being conducted)  

• Level 2: Managed (people doing work have access to adequate  resources to get job done, stakeholders are actively involved, work  tasks and products are monitored, reviewed, and evaluated for  conformance to process description)  

• Level 3: Defined (management and engineering processes  documented, standardized, and integrated into organization-wide  software process)  

• Level 4: Quantitatively Managed (software process and products  are quantitatively understood and controlled using detailed  measures) 

• Level 5: Optimizing (continuous process improvement is enabled by  quantitative feedback from the process and testing innovative ideas)

##  Process Patterns

• Generic software pattern elements 

–Meaningful pattern name 

–Intent (objective of pattern)  

–Type 

• Task pattern (defines engineering action or work task)  

• Stage pattern (defines framework activity for the process)  

• Phase pattern (defines sequence or flow of framework activities that occur  within process) 

–Initial context (describes conditions that must be present prior to using  pattern)  

–Solution (describes how to implement pattern correctly)  

–Resulting context (describes conditions that result when pattern has  been implemented successfully)  

–Related patterns (links to patterns directly related to this one)  

–Known uses/examples (instances in which pattern is applicable)

## Process Assessment

## Personal and Team Process Models

Personal Software Process (PSP) 

Recommends five framework activities: 

1. Planning 
2. High-level design 
3. High-level design review 
4. Development 
5. Postmortem

 Stresses the need for each software engineer to identify errors  early and as important, to understand the types of errors
